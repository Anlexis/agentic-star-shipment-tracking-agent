    ``input_context`` carries the two options the pipeline validates:
    ``tracking_number`` (an alphanumeric consignment reference, 1–18 chars) and
    ``deployment_mode`` ("coordinator" or "customer_facing"). Both are optional;
    absent values fall back to the documented defaults, and the tracking number
    is otherwise read from the question itself.

    Send the consignment reference here when it is a bare digit run. Free-text
    input passes through a personal-data mask before any node sees it, and a
    12-digit run is indistinguishable from a national identification number, so
    such a reference does not survive the narrative channel intact.
